# LumaBridge

[中文说明](./README.zh-CN.md)

LumaBridge is a browser-side Dolby Vision Profile 5 to SDR preview and verification tool. The project is focused on testing whether a web stack can expose raw 10-bit video frames, parse Dolby Vision RPU metadata, and render diagnostic SDR output through WebGPU.

This is an engineering and verification project, not a finished production transcoder.

## Live Demo

- App: <https://ekxs-dev.github.io/LumaBridge/>
- Benchmark page: <https://ekxs-dev.github.io/LumaBridge/bench/>

The GitHub Pages build is useful for capability checks and UI testing. GitHub Pages does not provide the COOP/COEP headers required for `SharedArrayBuffer`, so the hosted demo may fall back to single-thread `ffmpeg.wasm`. Use local development for the best diagnostic path with `@ffmpeg/core-mt`.

## Distance From Usable Playback

The current stage is closer to a verification bench and diagnostic tool than a day-to-day DV P5 to SDR player.

What is usable today:

- Decode a selected timestamp into a raw `I420P10` frame.
- Inspect Raw luma / DV P5 base / PQ SDR approximation previews.
- Compare the current raw WebGPU preview against a libplacebo PNG reference.
- Use fast opaque previews to confirm browser decode speed, motion, and visibility.
- Use the low-FPS ffmpeg.wasm chunk fallback for rough visual tracking.

The reliable correctness path today is:

```text
selected timestamp
  -> ffmpeg.wasm raw I420P10 decode
  -> matching RPU metadata parse
  -> WebGPU diagnostic SDR render
  -> manual comparison against a libplacebo PNG
```

What is not usable yet:

- Correct-color 4K DV P5 playback at 24/30/60fps.
- Stable raw `I420P10` plane access in a pure Chrome/WebCodecs path.
- A full replacement for libplacebo DV reshape, gamut mapping, and tone mapping.

The main blockers are:

- Chrome/WebCodecs needs to expose HEVC Main10 / DV P5 frames as raw `I420P10`, or provide equivalent high-bit-depth raw access.
- `ffmpeg.wasm` or another browser-side decoder path needs a large performance jump; otherwise the raw path is limited to single-frame, short-clip, and low-FPS diagnostics.

Related Chromium issue: [WebGPU HDR texture support](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40944011). It tracks HDR and high-bit-depth limitations around `importExternalTexture()` / `copyExternalImageToTexture()`, including precision loss, sRGB/RGBA8 conversion, HDR headroom clamping, and the lack of stable access to original 10-bit/HDR data inside WebGPU.

Without one of those improvements, the practical correct path is a native helper or server-side decode/conversion pipeline, with the browser handling UI, metadata, WebGPU preview, and verification.

## Current Status

The current implementation can:

- Parse MP4 inputs and prefix-parse large Matroska inputs.
- Detect HEVC codec strings and Dolby Vision RPU NAL units.
- Probe WebCodecs support and classify raw-frame access.
- Decode raw `I420P10` frames through `ffmpeg.wasm` fallback.
- Parse selected-frame Dolby Vision RPU metadata through Rust/WASM.
- Upload raw Y/U/V planes into WebGPU buffers.
- Render diagnostic SDR previews with WGSL.
- Manually compare a raw WebGPU preview against a libplacebo PNG reference.
- Run fast WebCodecs and WebGPU opaque-frame previews for speed and visibility checks.

The strict browser-native path is not complete yet:

```text
demux
  -> WebCodecs VideoDecoder
  -> VideoFrame.copyTo() as I420P10
  -> WebGPU raw YUV/RPU rendering
```

For the current DV P5 test samples, Chrome can decode opaque WebCodecs frames, but does not expose `I420P10` raw planes via `copyTo()`. The fast opaque paths are useful for previewing motion and decode speed, but they are not reference-correct DV P5 to SDR paths.

## Key Browser Judgment

Chrome can decode the current HEVC/DV P5 samples through WebCodecs, but the output is an opaque frame:

```text
VideoFrame.format === null
VideoFrame.copyTo() raw I420P10 is unavailable
```

That means the fast browser path can display frames quickly, but it cannot be used as the correct DV P5 to SDR path.

The only current browser-side path that exposes raw 10-bit frames is:

```text
ffmpeg.wasm
  -> raw yuv420p10le / I420P10
  -> Rust/WASM RPU metadata
  -> WebGPU WGSL diagnostic render
```

This path is useful for correctness checks, selected-frame inspection, low-FPS visual tracking, and libplacebo alignment work. It is not practical for 4K 24/30/60fps realtime playback.

## Architecture

```text
TypeScript
  -> file input, UI, benchmark page
  -> MP4 / Matroska metadata parsing
  -> WebCodecs probing and preview
  -> ffmpeg.wasm fallback adapter
  -> WebGPU upload/render orchestration

Rust + WASM
  -> HEVC NAL parsing
  -> Dolby Vision RPU extraction and parsing
  -> compact metadata packing for WGSL

WGSL
  -> I420P10 YUV sampling
  -> DV/PQ/BT.2020 diagnostic processing
  -> SDR preview output
```

## Preview Paths

### Raw Diagnostic Path

```text
ffmpeg.wasm raw I420P10
  -> Rust/WASM RPU metadata
  -> WebGPU WGSL diagnostic render
```

Use this path for selected-frame correctness work and libplacebo reference comparison. It is not fast enough for full 4K realtime playback.

### Fast WebCodecs Canvas Preview

```text
WebCodecs opaque VideoFrame
  -> canvas drawImage()
```

Use this path to check browser decode speed, start-time behavior, and whether motion is visible. The input has already been converted into browser-managed opaque RGB and cannot be used for reference color comparison.

### Fast WebGPU Opaque Preview

```text
WebCodecs opaque VideoFrame
  -> GPUExternalTexture
  -> simple WebGPU shader
```

Use this path to validate WebGPU external texture rendering, UI behavior, and frame pacing. It also starts from browser-converted opaque RGB, is not the correct DV P5 SDR path, and does not feed reference comparison.

The old `external recovery` matrix/range/channel selector was removed. Manual 8.5s diagnostics showed that BT.709/BT.2020, full/limited, UV swap, and channel-flip combinations could not recover the correct DV P5 base signal from Chrome opaque RGB frames. Keeping those controls made the UI look like the opaque path could be tuned into a correct path, which was misleading.

## Performance Snapshot

Observed on a large local DV P5 Matroska sample:

```text
3840 x 1608
ffmpeg.wasm core-mt available
target 4 fps
actual around 2 fps
one observed 5-frame chunk decode around 162 ms
one observed average frame time around 413 ms
```

Short segment decoding is much better than seeking once per frame, but it is still far from 4K 24/30/60fps.

Normal video-rate playback with correct DV P5 SDR still needs one of these paths:

- Future browser WebCodecs support for real `I420P10` frames with `copyTo()`.
- A native helper that decodes HEVC Main10 and passes raw frames to the page.
- Server-side decode and color processing.
- A browser-side decoder path much faster than current `ffmpeg.wasm`.

## Correctness Gap

RPU parsing and compact metadata packing now have useful test coverage. The largest known gap is after DV decode, in color mapping and gamut behavior:

```text
libplacebo:
reshape
  -> nonlinear matrix/offset
  -> PQ EOTF
  -> HPE LMS / BT.2020 matrix path
  -> PQ OETF
  -> full color_map / gamut mapping

current WGSL:
reshape diagnostics
  -> simplified BT.2390/IPT-style SDR mapping
  -> RGB softclip
```

The next correctness work should focus on libplacebo-style post-DV color mapping and gamut behavior.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer.
- npm.
- Chrome or Edge with WebCodecs and WebGPU support for the browser diagnostics.
- Rust toolchain for Rust/WASM tests and rebuilds.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/bench
```

The Vite dev server intentionally sends cross-origin isolation headers so `@ffmpeg/core-mt` can use `SharedArrayBuffer`.

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm run test
npm run build
npm run build:pages
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:rust
npm run build:wasm
```

## GitHub Pages

The repository deploys to GitHub Pages from `.github/workflows/pages.yml` on every push to `main`.

The Pages build uses:

```bash
npm run build:pages
```

The workflow uploads `dist/` with the base path set to `/LumaBridge/` and includes a static `/bench/` route copy for direct benchmark-page links.

## Repository Layout

```text
src/main.ts
  Vite app entry, home page, and benchmark page.

src/core/
  TypeScript parsing, probing, fallback, upload, reference comparison, and benchmark logic.

src/gpu/
  WGSL shaders for raw DV/PQ diagnostics and opaque WebGPU preview.

crates/lumabridge_wasm/
  Rust crate for HEVC/RPU parsing and compact metadata packing.

src/wasm/lumabridge_wasm/
  Generated wasm-bindgen browser package.

tests/
  Unit tests, Playwright smoke tests, fixtures, and references.
```

## Manual Testing

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/bench
```

Recommended checks:

- Select a local DV P5 test file.
- Confirm the fallback reports `ffmpeg.wasm` with `multi-thread`, `threaded`, and `isolated` when available.
- Render a raw `I420P10` WebGPU diagnostic frame at a selected timestamp.
- Use fast opaque preview only for speed and visibility.
- Use raw WebGPU SDR preview, not opaque preview, for libplacebo PNG reference comparison.

## Testing Policy

CI-style smoke tests should remain capability-aware. They should not fail only because a machine lacks HEVC hardware decode or WebGPU.

For cross-cutting changes, run:

```bash
npm run test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:rust
```

## Known Limitations

- Chrome currently exposes the tested DV P5 HEVC stream as opaque frames, not strict `I420P10` raw frames.
- `ffmpeg.wasm` raw decoding is useful for correctness diagnostics but not practical for 4K 24/30/60fps playback.
- Large Matroska files are currently prefix-parsed; full streaming demux is still pending.
- WGSL color mapping is diagnostic quality and not fully libplacebo-matched yet.
