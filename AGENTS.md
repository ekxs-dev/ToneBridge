# LumaBridge Agent Notes

## Project Overview
- Project name: `lumabridge`.
- Goal: browser-side Dolby Vision Profile 5 to SDR preview/verification tooling.
- Current state: test infrastructure, benchmark UI, fixtures, Rust/WASM parser skeleton, and WGSL shader skeleton are in place. The full demux -> WebCodecs -> `VideoFrame.copyTo()` -> WebGPU DV P5 pipeline is not complete yet.
- Primary browser target: Chrome/Edge first.
- Reference target: SDR BT.709, 100 nit, with sRGB display adaptation for page preview.

## Repository Layout
- `src/main.ts`: Vite app entry. Home page and `/bench` page are currently implemented here.
- `src/core/`: TypeScript capability checks, codec helpers, metadata packing, color math, and benchmark summaries.
- `src/gpu/dv-p5-to-sdr.wgsl`: WGSL shader skeleton for YUV10/DV/PQ/tone mapping work.
- `crates/lumabridge_wasm/`: Rust crate for HEVC NAL parsing, RPU extraction, metadata packing, and future libdovi integration.
- `tests/unit/`: Vitest unit tests.
- `tests/e2e/`: Playwright smoke/e2e tests.
- `tests/fixtures/`: Small versioned media fixtures.
- `tests/references/`: Golden metadata/reference outputs.
- `scripts/generate-fixtures.mjs`: Regenerates fixtures from `LUMABRIDGE_SOURCE` or `/path/to/input.mkv`.
- `source/`: ignored reference source tree, currently used for local libplacebo study. Do not include it in normal changes.

## Dev Environment Tips
- This repo uses `npm`, not `pnpm`.
- Install JS dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
- Open the benchmark page at `/bench`.
- Run Rust tests with `npm run test:rust`.
- Regenerate fixtures with `npm run bench:fixtures`.
- Override the source fixture file with:

```bash
LUMABRIDGE_SOURCE=/path/to/input.mkv npm run bench:fixtures
```

## Testing Instructions
- Run TypeScript unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

- Run the production build/typecheck:

```bash
npm run build
```

- Run Playwright e2e smoke tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

- Run Rust/WASM crate tests:

```bash
npm run test:rust
```

- Before considering a change done, run the checks relevant to the changed area. For cross-cutting work, run all four commands above.
- Add or update tests for every behavior change.
- Keep e2e tests capability-aware. Do not make CI fail solely because the machine lacks HEVC hardware decode or WebGPU.

## Fixture And Reference Constraints
- Keep fixtures small enough for repository smoke tests.
- Current DV fixture was cut from `/path/to/input.mkv`.
- `dv_p5_short.mp4` is HEVC Main10 DV P5 with RPU NAL units.
- Current golden RPU count for `tests/fixtures/dv_p5_short.mp4`: `154`.
- `sdr_reference.png` is generated with FFmpeg/libplacebo as the SDR reference frame.
- Updating golden/reference files should be intentional and reviewed.

## Implementation Constraints
- Do not claim the full DV P5 -> SDR pipeline is complete until actual demux, WebCodecs decode, `I420P10` copy, WebGPU upload, RPU metadata application, and reference image comparison are wired end to end.
- `ffmpeg.wasm` is not the intended main 4K decode path. Prefer WebCodecs for decode and Rust/WASM for RPU/container support.
- HDR10/PQ-only behavior is debug/fallback, not a valid DV P5 result.
- Benchmark timings on `/bench` are synthetic until the real pipeline is connected. The page already supports selecting and previewing a local video via native `<video>`.
- `/bench` also has diagnostic raw-frame preview controls: a time slider/seconds input plus Raw luma and PQ SDR approximation modes. Raw luma is the safer way to confirm decoded frames when DV P5 color appears green before RPU reshape is implemented.
- `/bench` shows selected-time Frame/RPU alignment for parsed samples: sample index, timestamp, RPU count, and first RPU NAL bytes. Large MKV files are still prefix-parsed, so seeks beyond that parsed window report unknown/outside until streaming demux is implemented.
- Compact DV metadata ABI is 276 `f32` values with WGSL `vec4` row padding. Keep `src/core/metadata.ts`, `crates/lumabridge_wasm/src/lib.rs`, and `src/gpu/dv-p5-to-sdr.wgsl` aligned.
- Rust `parse_rpu_metadata` is currently a placeholder returning identity metadata for valid payloads. Full libdovi/dovi_tool-compatible parsing is still pending.
- WGSL currently contains a skeleton/reference compute path, not libplacebo-accurate DV reshaping.

## PR / Commit Guidance
- Suggested title format: `[lumabridge] <Title>`.
- Keep changes scoped. Avoid touching `source/` unless the task explicitly concerns the reference source tree.
- Do not commit generated `dist/`, `node_modules/`, Playwright reports, or Rust `target/`.
- If changing public test fixtures, update `tests/README.md` and the golden assertions together.

## TODO
- [x] Add real MP4 track/sample metadata parser for benchmark file selection.
- [x] Add HEVC sample scanning for MP4 fixtures and surface RPU NAL counts in `/bench`.
- [x] Implement real MP4 demux metadata for HEVC samples and codec string extraction.
- [x] Feed MP4 samples into WebCodecs `VideoDecoder` for first-frame probing.
- [x] Probe `VideoFrame.copyTo()` on the first decoded frame and report I420P10 layout status.
- [x] Add MKV demux support or a WASM-backed MKV adapter.
- [x] Add WebCodecs-first decoder adapter with ffmpeg.wasm fallback probing.
- [x] Add automatic ffmpeg.wasm first-frame I420P10 diagnostic decode and SDR debug preview.
- [x] Add selectable timestamp controls for ffmpeg.wasm SDR debug preview frames.
- [x] Add Raw luma diagnostic preview mode for DV P5 frames before RPU color processing.
- [x] Add selected-time sample/RPU alignment diagnostics on `/bench`.
- [x] Report non-HEVC Matroska tracks as unsupported inputs instead of container parse failures.
- [ ] Turn ffmpeg.wasm fallback from first-frame diagnostic into a streaming/raw-frame adapter.
- [ ] Validate real `VideoFrame.format === "I420P10"` and `VideoFrame.colorSpace`.
- [ ] Copy real `VideoFrame` planes with `copyTo()` and upload Y/U/V data to WebGPU.
- [ ] Replace Rust placeholder RPU parsing with full libdovi/dovi_tool-compatible metadata extraction.
- [x] Define and freeze the compact metadata buffer ABI between Rust, TypeScript, and WGSL.
- [ ] Implement libplacebo-aligned DV polynomial/MMR reshape in WGSL.
- [ ] Add real SDR frame readback and pixel-error comparison against `sdr_reference.png`.
- [ ] Replace synthetic benchmark timings with measured demux/decode/copy/upload/shader/present timings.
- [ ] Add benchmark file-selection e2e that uploads a fixture and verifies metadata/report updates.
