# LumaBridge Agent Notes

## Project Overview
- Project name: `lumabridge`.
- Goal: browser-side Dolby Vision Profile 5 to SDR preview/verification tooling.
- Current state: test infrastructure, benchmark UI, fixtures, Rust/WASM parser skeleton, and WGSL shader skeleton are in place. The full demux -> WebCodecs -> `VideoFrame.copyTo()` -> WebGPU DV P5 pipeline is not complete yet.
- Primary browser target: Chrome/Edge first.
- Reference target intent: SDR BT.709, 100 nit. Current generated/manual FFmpeg `libplacebo` references do not explicitly override target peak, so libplacebo's default `PL_COLOR_SDR_WHITE = 203 nit` and BT.1886-style `color_trc=bt709` mapping are the practical browser comparison target until references are regenerated with an explicit 100 nit policy.

## Repository Layout
- `src/main.ts`: Vite app entry. Home page and `/bench` page are currently implemented here.
- `src/core/`: TypeScript capability checks, codec helpers, metadata packing, color math, and benchmark summaries.
- `src/core/rpu-metadata.ts`: Lazy browser adapter for generated Rust/WASM RPU metadata packing.
- `src/gpu/dv-p5-to-sdr.wgsl`: WGSL shader skeleton for YUV10/DV/PQ/tone mapping work.
- `crates/lumabridge_wasm/`: Rust crate for HEVC NAL parsing, RPU extraction, metadata packing, and future libdovi integration.
- `src/wasm/lumabridge_wasm/`: Generated wasm-bindgen browser package for the Rust RPU metadata parser.
- `tests/unit/`: Vitest unit tests.
- `tests/e2e/`: Playwright smoke/e2e tests.
- `tests/fixtures/`: Small versioned media fixtures.
- `tests/references/`: Golden metadata/reference outputs.
- `scripts/generate-fixtures.mjs`: Regenerates fixtures from `LUMABRIDGE_SOURCE` or `/path/to/input.mkv`.
- `source/`: ignored reference source tree, currently used for local libplacebo study. Do not include it in normal changes.

## Dev Environment Tips
- This repo uses `npm`, not `pnpm`.
- Install JS dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
- Open the benchmark page at `/bench`.
- Run Rust tests with `npm run test:rust`.
- Rebuild the generated Rust/WASM browser package with `npm run build:wasm`.
- Regenerate fixtures with `npm run bench:fixtures`.
- Override the source fixture file with:

```bash
LUMABRIDGE_SOURCE=/path/to/input.mkv npm run bench:fixtures
```

## Testing Instructions
- Run TypeScript unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

- Run the production build/typecheck:

```bash
npm run build
```

- Run Playwright e2e smoke tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

- Run Rust/WASM crate tests:

```bash
npm run test:rust
```

- Before considering a change done, run the checks relevant to the changed area. For cross-cutting work, run all four commands above.
- Add or update tests for every behavior change.
- Keep e2e tests capability-aware. Do not make CI fail solely because the machine lacks HEVC hardware decode or WebGPU.

## Fixture And Reference Constraints
- Keep fixtures small enough for repository smoke tests.
- Current DV fixture was cut from `/path/to/input.mkv`.
- `dv_p5_short.mp4` is HEVC Main10 DV P5 with RPU NAL units.
- Current golden RPU count for `tests/fixtures/dv_p5_short.mp4`: `154`.
- `sdr_reference.png` is generated with FFmpeg/libplacebo as the SDR reference frame. The current command uses `color_trc=bt709`, which libplacebo maps as a BT.1886 display curve, and no explicit 100 nit target override.
- Updating golden/reference files should be intentional and reviewed.

## Implementation Constraints
- Do not claim the full DV P5 -> SDR pipeline is complete until actual demux, WebCodecs decode, `I420P10` copy, WebGPU upload, RPU metadata application, and reference image comparison are wired end to end.
- `ffmpeg.wasm` is not the intended main 4K decode path. Prefer WebCodecs for decode and Rust/WASM for RPU/container support.
- HDR10/PQ-only behavior is debug/fallback, not a valid DV P5 result.
- Benchmark timings on `/bench` are synthetic until the real pipeline is connected. The page already supports selecting and previewing a local video via native `<video>`.
- `/bench` also has diagnostic raw-frame preview controls: a time slider/seconds input plus Raw luma, DV P5 base approximation, and PQ SDR approximation modes. Raw luma confirms decoded frame structure; DV P5 base approximation interprets the planes as IPT/PQ before RPU reshape; PQ SDR intentionally shows the incorrect HDR10-style path for comparison.
- `/bench` shows selected-time Frame/RPU alignment for parsed samples: sample index, timestamp, RPU count, and first RPU NAL bytes. Large MKV files are still prefix-parsed, so seeks beyond that parsed window report unknown/outside until streaming demux is implemented.
- When selected time is outside the parsed prefix and ffmpeg.wasm raw preview succeeds, `/bench` first tries a one-packet HEVC copy probe (`hevc_mp4toannexb`) at that time, scans the Annex-B packet for RPU NALs, then renders the debug preview with that selected-time RPU metadata when available. Raw-frame decode and packet probe use a hybrid seek (`input -ss` near the target plus output `-ss` for the final 2 seconds) to reduce off-by-keyframe diagnostics, but this is still a diagnostic fallback, not the final demux strategy.
- Compact DV metadata ABI v2 is 840 `f32` values with explicit `reshapeHeader`, padded pivots, per-piece method/order metadata, polynomial slots, full MMR coefficient slots, and `sourcePq = [sourceMin, sourceMax, level1Max, level1Avg]`. RPU luma pivots from the `dolby_vision` crate are cumulative deltas and must be accumulated before packing. MMR coefficients are packed like libplacebo as `[c0,c1,c2,pad] + [c3,c4,c5,c6]` per order. Keep `src/core/metadata.ts`, `crates/lumabridge_wasm/src/lib.rs`, and `src/gpu/dv-p5-to-sdr.wgsl` aligned.
- `src/core/gpu-upload.ts` prepares tightly packed `u32` Y/U/V storage-buffer data plus source/output frame params from I420P10 frames. `/bench` attempts a live WebGPU buffer upload after ffmpeg.wasm raw-frame decode when WebGPU is available.
- `src/core/rpu-metadata.ts` lazy-loads the generated Rust/WASM parser and converts selected-frame RPU NAL payloads into the 840-f32 compact shader metadata buffer. If parsing fails or no RPU payload is available, `/bench` falls back to identity metadata and reports that explicitly.
- `src/core/webgpu-render.ts` runs the WGSL compute shader against the ffmpeg.wasm raw frame and reads back an RGBA8 SDR debug preview when WebGPU is available. It now accepts packed RPU metadata, but the WGSL reshape math is still simplified/debug quality.
- `/bench` keeps the previous preview visible while a selected raw frame is being decoded/rendered and only draws the CPU preview as fallback, avoiding a CPU-to-WebGPU color flash during successful RPU renders.
- `/bench` can manually load a libplacebo PNG reference and compare the current SDR preview readback against it. The report records RGB MAE, per-channel MAE, signed RGB bias, output/reference averages, max-error pixel, outlier count, and a reference-gap diagnosis with likely causes/next checks; this is a manual diagnostic, not the final automated fixture parity gate yet.
- `/bench` avoids resetting the SDR canvas dimensions when the preview size is unchanged. This keeps the previous preview visible during re-renders and prevents the one-frame blank/flash seen while ffmpeg.wasm/WebGPU work is still in flight.
- `tests/unit/rpu-metadata.test.ts` now checks compact RPU metadata against FFmpeg Dolby Vision side-data fields for the first fixture frame: matrices, offsets, source PQ, pivots, and polynomial coefficients. If that test is green, the largest libplacebo gap is more likely in WGSL sampling/reshape/tone/gamut mapping or frame/RPU alignment than in Rust metadata packing.
- Rust `parse_rpu_metadata` now uses the MIT `dolby_vision` crate to parse real HEVC type-62 RPU payloads and fill compact metadata with Dolby matrices, offsets, source PQ, DV Level 1 max/avg PQ, pivots, and polynomial/MMR coefficient slots. It also retries ffmpeg single-packet RPU payloads with CRC-validated tail trimming because Annex-B copy probes can leave non-RPU bytes after the real RPU terminator. It is still pending final libplacebo parity for pivot interpretation, per-piece method/order packing, and shader application.
- The browser WASM package is built with rustup stable + `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm-bindgen-cli` 0.2.121 via `npm run build:wasm`.
- WGSL currently contains a debug compute path and simplified preview modes. It now applies ABI v2 RPU reshape metadata for diagnostics, the MMR basis terms and coefficient padding match libplacebo's `x*y`, `x*z`, `y*z`, `x*y*z` layout, the DV decode offset follows libplacebo's full-range `1024/1023` normalization, the DV nonlinear matrix output only clamps the lower bound before PQ EOTF like libplacebo, the DV post step avoids an extra PQ OETF/EOTF round trip, and the SDR diagnostic tone map uses a BT.2390-style IPT/PQ path using Level 1 max PQ when present instead of the old Reinhard path. For practical comparison against the current FFmpeg/libplacebo PNG command, WebGPU/CPU SDR diagnostics use libplacebo's default `PL_COLOR_SDR_WHITE = 203 nit`, force PQ black to `PL_COLOR_HDR_BLACK`, use an SDR black point of white/1000, and write BT.1886-style output for `color_trc=bt709`; raw luma remains an sRGB-ish structural diagnostic. The raw WebGPU preview samples luma/chroma bilinearly and assumes the current fixtures' `AVCHROMA_LOC_LEFT` 4:2:0 chroma siting. The result is not yet full libplacebo/reference validated.
- Current libplacebo gap focus: `pl_shader_dovi_reshape` and the packed RPU fields now have good coverage, so the next largest known mismatch is the simplified WebGPU color-map/gamut path after DV decode. libplacebo's DV decode path is reshape -> nonlinear matrix/offset -> PQ EOTF -> `(HPE LMS->BT.2020 * linear matrix)` -> PQ OETF -> full `pl_shader_color_map_ex`; our WGSL still approximates that color map with a direct BT.2390/IPT path and does not yet implement libplacebo's full perceptual gamut 3D LUT.
- Chrome currently rejects `meta` as a WGSL local identifier. Keep shader locals away from reserved keywords; `tests/unit/wgsl.test.ts` guards the regression that broke `/bench` WebGPU rendering.

## PR / Commit Guidance
- Suggested title format: `[lumabridge] <Title>`.
- Keep changes scoped. Avoid touching `source/` unless the task explicitly concerns the reference source tree.
- Do not commit generated `dist/`, `node_modules/`, Playwright reports, or Rust `target/`.
- If changing public test fixtures, update `tests/README.md` and the golden assertions together.
